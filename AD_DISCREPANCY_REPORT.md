# AD Paragraph Discrepancy Report

## Critical Findings

### Jacqueline's Affidavit - Invalid AD Paragraph References

The following AD paragraph references in Jacqueline's affidavit **DO NOT EXIST** in Peter's Founding Affidavit:

- INVALID: 10.7.1.4 does not exist in Founding Affidavit
- INVALID: 10.10.22 does not exist in Founding Affidavit
- INVALID: 10.10.41 does not exist in Founding Affidavit
- INVALID: 10.10.2.4 does not exist in Founding Affidavit

#### Analysis

These appear to be **typos or incorrect references**. The correct paragraphs should be:

- `10.7.1.4` → Should likely be `10.7.1.2` (the only 10.7.1.x paragraph in the PDF)
- `10.10.22` → Should likely be `10.10.2.2` (missing decimal point)
- `10.10.41` → Should likely be `10.10.2.1` (typo: 41 instead of 2.1)
- `10.10.2.4` → Does not exist; should be `10.10.2.3` (last sub-paragraph is 10.10.2.3)

### Sections 4, 5, and 15 Not Addressed

**NOTE:** The refined affidavits do not explicitly address:
- **Section 4 (Jurisdiction)** - This is typically not disputed
- **Section 5 (Locus Standi)** - This is typically not disputed
- **Section 15** - This section does not exist in the PDF (jumps from 14 to 16)

## Recommendations

1. **Correct the invalid AD paragraph references in Jacqueline's affidavit**
2. **Consider whether Sections 4 and 5 need explicit responses** (typically not required)
3. **Verify all range references** (e.g., "7-7.20") cover all paragraphs in that range
