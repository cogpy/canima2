## 2. Numbering Strategy by Group

### Group A: Legal Opening (Sections 1-6)

**Approach:** Use traditional paragraph numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.) without JR/DR prefixes

**Rationale:**
- These sections establish legal framework and standing
- Content is largely factual and non-contentious
- Responses are brief confirmations or denials
- JR/DR numbering would be unnecessarily complex for simple statements

**Example:**
```markdown
### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY

1.1 I am JACQUELINE FAUCITT, a major businesswoman with identity number 570607 0898 18 1.

1.2 I am resident at [address].

1.3 The facts herein contained fall within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.
```

### Group B: Testimony-Specific Sections (Sections 7-11)

**Approach:** Use JR/DR numbering that mirrors AD paragraph numbers

**Rationale:**
- These sections contain substantive testimony and evidence
- Direct traceability to AD paragraphs is critical
- Multiple sub-points often needed for complex allegations
- Coherence between JR and DR responses creates synergy

**Example:**
```markdown
### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

JR 7.1 I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant attended in mid-June 2025...

JR 7.2 The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies "noted discrepancies" is a misrepresentation...

JR 7.5.1 The Applicant's claim that payments "could not be explained" is false...

JR 7.5.2 The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025...

JR 7.5.3 The Applicant cancelled his own card "for the sake thereof"...
```

### Group C: Legal Closing (Sections 12-18)

**Approach:** Use traditional paragraph numbering (12.1, 12.2, etc.) without JR/DR prefixes

**Rationale:**
- These sections respond to legal arguments and procedural matters
- Content is primarily legal analysis rather than factual testimony
- Responses address legal requirements (urgency, necessity, etc.)
- Traditional numbering maintains professional legal format

**Example:**
```markdown
### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.1-13.7: INTERDICTORY RELIEF

13.1 The Applicant has failed to establish a clear right for interdictory relief...

13.2 The balance of convenience does not favor the Applicant...

13.3 The Applicant's delay in seeking relief undermines the urgency claim...
```

**Response Format:**

### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST

### GROUP C: LEGAL CLOSING (Sections 12-18)

#### Section 12: Necessity of Relief (AD 12.1-12.4)

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 12.1-12.4: NECESSITY OF RELIEF

12.1 The Applicant has failed to establish necessity for the relief sought.

12.2 The Applicant created the crisis he now complains about through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.

12.3 The Applicant has alternative remedies available, including his absolute powers as trustee.

12.4 The relief sought is disproportionate and punitive rather than protective.
```

**AD Paragraphs:**
- AD 13.1: Requirements for interdict
- AD 13.2-13.2.2: Clear right
- AD 13.3: Irreparable harm
- AD 13.4: No alternative remedy

- AD 13.7: Relief under Part A

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.1-13.7: INTERDICTORY RELIEF

13.1 The Applicant has failed to establish the requirements for interdictory relief.

13.2 The Applicant has no clear right. The alleged misconduct is contradicted by evidence.

13.3 The Applicant has failed to establish irreparable harm. The harm was self-inflicted.

13.4 The Applicant has alternative remedies, including his trustee powers.

13.5 The balance of convenience favors the Respondents. The interdict would destroy a R34.9M operation.

13.6 The Applicant's delay undermines the urgency claim.

13.7 The relief sought under Part A is unjustified and should be refused.
```

#### Section 14: Other Relief Sought (AD 14.1-14.5)

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 14. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT AND OTHER RELIEF

14.1 The Applicant seeks a forensic audit. This is disingenuous given Mr. Bantjies's conflict of interest.

14.2 Any forensic audit must be conducted by an independent auditor, not one selected by the conflicted Applicant.

14.3 The audit must include Villa Via's 86% profit margin, the R5.4M stock adjustment, and Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt.

14.4 The costs of any audit should be borne by the Applicant, who created this crisis.

14.5 Other relief sought is opposed for reasons stated herein.
```

#### Section 15: Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)

**Note:** Section 15 doesn't exist in Peter's affidavit; it jumps from 14 to 16.

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 15. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: URGENCY

15.1 The Applicant's urgency claim is contradicted by the two-month delay between alleged discovery (mid-June) and application (August).

15.2 The Applicant created the urgency through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.

15.3 The doctrine of *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel) applies. The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he created.

[Continue addressing each urgency ground]
```

#### Section 16: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.1-17.4)

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 16. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.1-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS

16.1 The Applicant's ex parte application was improper and based on material non-disclosures.

16.2 The Applicant failed to disclose Mr. Bantjies's triple conflict (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant).

16.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the timeline showing retaliation (reports 6 June → cards cancelled 7 June).

16.4 The ex parte order should be set aside due to material non-disclosures and false statements.
```

#### Section 17: Remaining Paragraphs

**Various AD paragraphs not covered in main sections**

#### Section 18: Conclusion

**Response Format:**
```markdown
### 18. CONCLUSION

18.1 The Applicant's application is founded on material non-disclosures, false statements, and manufactured crises.

18.3 The relief sought should be refused with costs.

18.4 The Respondents reserve the right to supplement this affidavit with further evidence as it becomes available.
