## 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

### Response to AD 7.1-7.3: Accountant's Investigation

**JR 7.1** I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant, Mr. Danie Bantjies, attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent). Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries, and owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**).

**JR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies "noted discrepancies" in July 2025 is a misrepresentation. The discrepancies were reported **to** Mr. Bantjies by the Second Respondent on 6 June 2025. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (Annexure **DF4**), demonstrating consciousness of guilt and retaliation for the exposure of fraud.

**JR 7.3** The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate IT expenses as "irregular payments." These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software infrastructure required to generate **R34.9 million** in annual revenue. The true irregularities are: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales); (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.

### Response to AD 7.4-7.6: Card Cancellations and Manufactured Crisis

**JR 7.4** The Applicant's characterization of the Second Respondent's conduct as "increasingly erratic" is unfounded and defamatory. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. His conduct was professional and transparent, as evidenced by his provision of comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**JR 7.5.1** The Applicant's claim that payments "could not be explained" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025, including detailed financial analysis and evidence of fraud.

**JR 7.5.2** The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025**, one day after receiving the Second Respondent's reports. This timing demonstrates a manufactured crisis and application of the doctrine of *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel). The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he deliberately created.

**JR 7.5.3** The Applicant cancelled his own card "for the sake thereof," suggesting awareness that the card cancellations were punitive rather than protective.

**JR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that "the majority of the transactions remain unexplained" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of the retaliation strategy.

### Response to AD 7.7-7.9: Service Interruptions

**JR 7.7** I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused service interruptions, including the halting of internet domains and essential business subscriptions. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**JR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent "adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist" is false. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's characterization is an attempt to justify his retaliatory conduct.

**JR 7.9** The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate the Second Respondent's professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following the card cancellations.

### Response to AD 7.10-7.12: Email Access and Staff Interference

**JR 7.10** The Applicant's communications were with the Second Respondent's personal assistant because the Applicant had already cancelled the business credit cards, creating a crisis that required immediate attention.

**JR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that the Second Respondent "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial documentation.

**JR 7.12** The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent "interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs" is an inversion of the facts. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who:
- Cancelled 15 business credit cards (7 June 2025)
- Revoked the Second Respondent's email access (retaliation for reporting fraud)
- Diverted company revenue to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son
- Expunged Shopify audit data (22 May 2025)

### Response to AD 7.13-7.15: Email Account Access

**JR 7.13.1** The Applicant's claim regarding email access is misleading. The Second Respondent's access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025.

**JR 7.13.2** The selective restoration of email access "on an ad hoc basis" was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who had control of the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com) and all company systems (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**).

**JR 7.14** The "continued interference" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents, including:
- Revenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)
- Revenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure **DF12**)
- Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF8**)
- Warehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure **DF13**)

**JR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation in retaliation for the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud.

### Response to AD 7.16-7.17: Duplicate Cards

**JR 7.16.1** I confirm that I approached the banks (FNB and ABSA) to obtain duplicate cards on or about 24 June 2025. This action was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business operations following the Applicant's punitive card cancellations on 7 June 2025.

**JR 7.16.2** The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith and the manufactured nature of the crisis.

**JR 7.17.1** The Applicant's claim that I "rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part" is false. I defended the Second Respondent because he had acted professionally and transparently, providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.

**JR 7.17.2** The Applicant's characterization of my response as "I will show you" is a misrepresentation designed to portray me as defiant rather than protective of legitimate business interests.

### Response to AD 7.18-7.20: Alleged Birthday Gift

**JR 7.18.1** I deny transferring R500,000 to the Second Respondent on or about 16 July 2025 as a "birthday gift." This allegation is false and unsupported by evidence.

**JR 7.18.2** The Applicant's claim that I have "no other sources of income other than remuneration by the third to sixth respondents" is irrelevant to the allegations and appears designed to undermine my financial independence.

**JR 7.18.3** If any transfer occurred on 16 July 2025, it would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift. The Applicant provides no evidence (bank statements, invoices, or transfer documentation) to support this allegation.

**JR 7.19** I deny that any transfer was made "without the Applicant's knowledge." As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions.

**JR 7.20** The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was "separate to remuneration as director/member" is speculative and unsupported. The Second Respondent's remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.
