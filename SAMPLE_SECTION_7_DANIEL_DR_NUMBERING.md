## 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

### Response to AD 7.1-7.3: Accountant's Investigation

**DR 7.1** I deny the Applicant's claim that Mr. Danie Bantjies attended the office in mid-June 2025 for routine tax submissions. On **6 June 2025**, I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies exposing fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent charged to the group). Mr. Bantjies is the undisclosed third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and owes the Applicant R18.685 million, creating an irreconcilable conflict of interest (Annexure **SF1**).

**DR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies "noted discrepancies" in July 2025 is a deliberate misrepresentation of the timeline. I reported the discrepancies **to** Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate response was to cancel 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** (Annexure **DF4**), demonstrating retaliation and consciousness of guilt.

**DR 7.3** The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate operational expenses as "irregular payments." These IT expenses are essential for operating 51 Shopify stores generating **R34.9 million** in annual revenue. The actual irregularities I reported on 6 June 2025 were: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC; (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.

### Response to AD 7.4-7.6: Card Cancellations and Manufactured Crisis

**DR 7.4** The Applicant's characterization of my conduct as "increasingly erratic" is false and defamatory. I was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. My conduct was professional, transparent, and in the best interests of the corporations, as evidenced by my comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.5.1** The Applicant's claim that payments "could not be explained" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports I provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial analysis, evidence of fraud, and recommendations for remedial action.

**DR 7.5.2** The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025**, exactly one day after I provided my reports exposing fraud. This timing is not coincidental—it demonstrates a manufactured crisis designed to punish me for reporting financial misconduct and to create a pretext for this application.

**DR 7.5.3** The Applicant's cancellation of his own card "for the sake thereof" reveals that the card cancellations were punitive theater rather than genuine protective measures. If the Applicant genuinely believed there was misconduct, he would not have cancelled his own access to business funds.

**DR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that "the majority of the transactions remain unexplained" is false. I provided comprehensive documentation on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of his retaliation strategy following my exposure of fraud.

### Response to AD 7.7-7.9: Service Interruptions

**DR 7.7** I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused immediate service interruptions, including the suspension of critical internet domains, Shopify subscriptions, and software licenses essential to the R34.9 million operation. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's punitive actions.

**DR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that I "adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist" is a complete inversion of the facts. I had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025 by exposing fraud and recommending remedial action. The Applicant's characterization is designed to justify his retaliatory conduct.

**DR 7.9** The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate my professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following his deliberate sabotage of business operations through card cancellations.

### Response to AD 7.10-7.12: Email Access and Staff Interference

**DR 7.10** The Applicant's communications were directed to my personal assistant because the Applicant had created a crisis by cancelling 15 business credit cards, requiring immediate crisis management to prevent total business collapse.

**DR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that I "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive financial documentation I provided to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, including invoices, bank statements, and detailed analysis of the fraud schemes.

**DR 7.12** The Applicant's allegation that I "interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs" is a projection of his own conduct. The actual interference came from the Applicant and his agents:
- Card cancellations rendering staff unable to pay for essential services (7 June 2025)
- Revocation of my email and system access in retaliation for reporting fraud
- Revenue diversion to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son
- Expungement of Shopify audit data (22 May 2025, Annexure **JF4**)
- Warehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure **DF13**)

### Response to AD 7.13-7.15: Email Account Access

**DR 7.13.1** The Applicant's claim regarding email access is deliberately misleading. My access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025. This revocation was orchestrated by Ms. Farrar, who controlled all company systems.

**DR 7.13.2** The selective restoration of email access "on an ad hoc basis" was not my decision—it was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who had unauthorized control of the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com) and acted under Mr. Bantjies's instructions (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**).

**DR 7.14** The "continued interference" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents following my exposure of fraud:
- Revenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)
- Revenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure **DF12**)
- Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, a competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF8**)
- Warehouse access sabotage preventing fulfillment of customer orders (July 2025, Annexure **DF13**)

**DR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation. This sabotage was in retaliation for my exposure of fraud and demonstrates the Applicant's prioritization of concealing wrongdoing over corporate interests.

### Response to AD 7.16-7.17: Duplicate Cards

**DR 7.16.1** I am aware that the First Respondent approached the banks to obtain duplicate cards on or about 24 June 2025. This action was necessary to prevent the total collapse of business operations following the Applicant's punitive card cancellations on 7 June 2025.

**DR 7.16.2** I was compelled to use my personal credit cards to maintain critical business services, demonstrating the Applicant's bad faith and the manufactured nature of the crisis. This personal financial exposure was necessary to protect the R34.9 million operation from the Applicant's sabotage.

**DR 7.17.1** The Applicant's claim that the First Respondent "rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect" on my part is accurate—because there was no malfeasance or neglect. I had acted professionally and transparently, providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.17.2** The Applicant's characterization of the First Respondent's response as "I will show you" is designed to portray her as defiant rather than protective of legitimate business interests and her son's professional reputation.

### Response to AD 7.18-7.20: Alleged Birthday Gift

**DR 7.18.1** I deny receiving R500,000 from the First Respondent on or about 16 July 2025 as a "birthday gift." This allegation is false and unsupported by any bank statements, transfer documentation, or other evidence.

**DR 7.18.2** The Applicant's reference to my birthday (15 July, based on my ID number 820715 5300 18 2) appears designed to create an emotional narrative rather than present factual evidence. No such transfer occurred.

**DR 7.18.3** If any transfer occurred on 16 July 2025, it would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift. The Applicant provides no documentary evidence to support this serious allegation.

**DR 7.19** I deny that any transfer was made "without the Applicant's knowledge." As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility and control of all financial transactions.

**DR 7.20** The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was "separate to remuneration as director/member" is speculative. My remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation, which I built from the ground up with my late partner, Kayla Pretorius.
