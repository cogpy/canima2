**Document Type:** Answering Affidavit (Version 8 - DR Numbering)  
**Date:** November 2, 2025

## I, THE UNDERSIGNED

**DANIEL FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and say:

---

### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES

**DR 7.1** I confirm that I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on **6 June 2025**, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. Mr. Bantjies, as the Applicant's accountant and a concealed trustee, had a duty to investigate these claims. Instead, he dismissed my request for an audit.

**DR 7.2** The Applicant's claim that discrepancies were "noted" in July is false. I reported them on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's immediate cancellation of 15 business credit cards on **7 June 2025** was a direct act of retaliation and sabotage.

**DR 7.3** The IT expenses were legitimate and necessary for the R34.9 million e-commerce operation I built. The true irregularities, which I reported, were the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

**DR 7.4** My conduct was professional and transparent. I built a profitable global business. The Applicant's characterization of my conduct as "erratic" is a self-serving attempt to justify his retaliatory actions.

**DR 7.5.1** The Applicant's claim that payments were "unexplained" is false. I provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.5.2** The card cancellations on 7 June 2025 were a manufactured crisis designed to create the pretext for this application.

**DR 7.5.3** The Applicant's cancellation of his own card was punitive theater, designed to create the illusion of a genuine crisis.

**DR 7.6** The Applicant's claim that transactions remain "unexplained" is false. The reports I provided on 6 June 2025 contained all necessary explanations.

**DR 7.7** The service interruptions were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.

**DR 7.8** The Applicant's allegation that I "refused to assist" is false. I had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.9** The communications in Annexure PF7 demonstrate my professionalism in the face of the Applicant's manufactured crisis.

**DR 7.10** The communications with my personal assistant were necessary because the Applicant had created a crisis that required immediate attention.

**DR 7.11** The Applicant's claim that I "would or could not provide relevant invoices" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports I provided on 6 June 2025.

**DR 7.12** The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically sabotaged the business operations.

**DR 7.13.1** My email and system access was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct.

**DR 7.13.2** The selective restoration of access was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who was acting under the Applicant's instructions.

**DR 7.14** The "continued interference" was a systematic campaign of sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents.

**DR 7.15** The conduct "not in the interests of the corporations" was the Applicant's dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation.

**DR 7.16.1** The First Respondent's action to obtain duplicate cards was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business.

**DR 7.16.2** The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith.

**DR 7.17.1** The First Respondent defended my professional and transparent conduct.

**DR 7.17.2** The Applicant's characterization of the First Respondent's response is a misrepresentation.

**DR 7.18.1** I deny receiving a R500,000 "birthday gift." This is a false and unsupported allegation.

**DR 7.18.2** The Applicant's reference to the First Respondent's income is irrelevant and designed to undermine her.

**DR 7.18.3** Any transfer would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift.

**DR 7.19** The Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions through his agents, Ms. Farrar and Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 7.20** My remuneration included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.

---

### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.1-8.10: IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS

**DR 8.1** The IT expenses were necessary for the R34.9 million global e-commerce operation I built.

**DR 8.2** The expense categories are standard for a global e-commerce business.

**DR 8.3** The expense amounts are proportional to the revenue generated.

**DR 8.4** I discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.

**DR 8.5** The investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies.

**DR 8.6** The IT vendors are legitimate and well-known providers of e-commerce services.

**DR 8.7** I provided comprehensive documentation of all IT expenses on 6 June 2025.

**DR 8.8** International payments are a standard part of a global e-commerce business.

**DR 8.9** The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications.

**DR 8.10** The true financial irregularities are the R5.4 million stock adjustment, the R900,000 unauthorized transfers, and Villa Via's 86% profit extraction.

---

### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 9.1-9.4: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT SUMMARY

**DR 9.1** The Applicant's summary is an inversion of the facts.

**DR 9.2** The bank message is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct.
