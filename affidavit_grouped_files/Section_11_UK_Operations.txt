11.	UK OPERATIONS
AD 11.1
I pause to mention that, we also began companies in the United Kingdom, which sell the applicant's products - and which my son has been appointed to direct and manage.
AD 11.2
These companies fall under the UK head oﬃce, being RegimA UK Ltd.
AD 11.3
My wife, my son, and I are the directors thereof.
AD 11.4
While my involvement has been minimal I, inter alia, ensure operational growth, and manage the respondent corporations.
AD 11.5
My son was appointed to oversee the UK branch, which carries under it, as umbrella, RegimA @ Dr H Ltd, RegimA Zone Ltd, RegimA Zone Academy Ltd and RegimA Medic Ltd.

AD 11.6
The third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom due to apparent fraud that transpired in the UK in the past, from which the UK companies allegedly required time to again become ﬁnancially viable.
AD 11.7
This was perpetrated by the then managing director of the UK branch, Isaac Chesno, which resultant in our son's appointment.
AD 11.8
I fear (due to his present conduct) that the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse.
AD 11.9
I accordingly have no idea pertaining to the ﬁnancial wellness of the UK branches, and intend to approach the relevant Court for relief with regards thereto.
