8.	IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS
AD 8.1
In addition to the aforesaid, I annex hereto the IT related expenses (annexure "PF9" hereto) which my son has approved and/or paid over the 2024 to 2025 ﬁnancial year.
AD 8.2
Other than a few, such as Sage (being accounting software), the majority are unexplained, and we have almost no invoices for these items which creates, inter alia, major tax problems.
AD 8.3
The 'expenses' from March 2025, to June 2025, relating to computer related costs solely, are attached hereto marked "PF10".
AD 8.4
The 2024 tax year 'expenses', for this category alone, amount to R6,738,007.47.

AD 8.5
The 2025 tax year, thus far, for this category only, amounts to R2,116,159.47.
AD 8.6
These amounts exclude the 'birthday gift', aforesaid, and are almost entirely unexplainable.
AD 8.7
Many of the 'expenses' are also seemingly international.
AD 8.8
Annexed hereto marked "PF11" is a screenshot of a message received from the seventh respondent bank, on or about 05 August 2025, conﬁrming that the business accounts have almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving the Republic of South Africa (I note, in this regard, that the corporations bank together, eﬀectively as a group of companies - their funds are inter alia pooled as necessary).

AD 8.9
Not only is this inexplicable, but it will probably cause further, and serious, tax implications for the applicant corporations, to their signiﬁcant detriment.
AD 8.10
For the sake of inter alia the South African Revenue Services, and the Reserve Bank, the corporations will, as it stands, be unable to explain these international expenses.
