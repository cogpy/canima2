10.	DELINQUENCY AND PROBATION APPLICATION
AD 10.1
I seek, as ﬁnal relief under PART B of the notice of motion, an order declaring the ﬁrst and second respondents delinquent, alternatively placing them under probation.
AD 10.2
I deal therewith at the outset, as their conduct justifying that relief explains the necessity for the relief I seek under PART A.
AD 10.3
My son and wife are, with respect, clearly and evidently acting in a manner which is detrimental to the third to the sixth respondent corporations, and to me, to the extent that their conduct is delinquent alternatively justiﬁes them being placed under probation.
AD 10.4
Their conduct is in clear contravention of the Companies Act, No 71 of 2008, and the Close Corporations Act, No 69 of 1974 (the "Close Corporations Act").

AD 10.5
Legal Grounds for Relief
AD 10.5.1
Declaring the ﬁrst and/or second Respondent/s delinquent, as envisaged in Section 162(5) (a)-(c) of the Companies Act, read together at Section 69(8) (a) of the Companies Act, read together with Section 162(5)(f)(ii) thereof, and Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act; alternatively
AD 10.5.2
Placing the ﬁrst and/or second Respondent/s under probation, for which provision is made in Section 162(7)(a)-(c), and Section 162(8) of the Companies Act, taking into account Section 162(5)(f)(ii) thereof, and Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act.

AD 10.6
Fiduciary Duties Under Close Corporations Act Section 42 of the Close Corporations Act provides that every member of a close corporation stands in a ﬁduciary relationship [Section 42(1)] with that corporation shall:
AD 10.6.1
Exercise such powers as he may have to manage or represent the corporation in the interest and for the beneﬁt of the corporation; [Section 42 (2)(a)(i)] and
AD 10.6.2
Shall not act without or exceed his powers; [Sec 42(2)(a)(ii)]
AD 10.6.3
Shall avoid any material conﬂict between his own interests and those of the corporation, and in particular shall not derive any personal economic beneﬁt to which he is not entitled by reason of his membership of or service to the corporation, from the corporation or from any other person in circumstances where that beneﬁt is obtained in conﬂict with the interests of the corporation; [Section 42(2)(b)(i)]

AD 10.7
Liability for Breach Section 42 provides further that a member of a corporation whose act or omission has breached any duty arising from his ﬁduciary relationship shall be liable to the corporation for â
AD 10.7.1.1
Any loss suﬀered as a result thereof by the corporation; [Section 42 (3)(a)(i)] or
AD 10.7.1.2
any economic beneﬁt derived by the member by reason thereof [Section 42(3)(a) (ii)].
AD 10.8
Disqualiﬁcation Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act recognises that a person removed from an oﬃce of trust on account of misconduct shall be disqualiﬁed from participating in the management of a corporation (save under the authority of a Court).

AD 10.9
Grounds for Declaring Delinquency Section 162(5) of the Companies Act provides for the mandatory disqualiﬁcation of a person (by declaring him delinquent) from serving as a director (or close corporation) of a company, and a member of a close corporation [at Section 162 (5)(f)(ii)] under circumstances where a person (such as my wife, and son):
AD 10.9.1
Grossly abused the position of director (or member); [Section 162(5)(c) (i)]
AD 10.9.2
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iii), Intentionally, or by gross negligence, inﬂicted harm upon the company (or close corporation), contrary to Section 76 (2)(a);

AD 10.9.3
Acted in a manner:
AD 10.9.3.1
Amounting to gross negligence, wilful misconduct or breach of trust in relation to the performance of the director's (or member's) functions within, and duties to, the company (or close corporation); [Section 76(5)(c)(iv)(aa)]
AD 10.9.3.2
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iv)(bb), Acquiesced [per Section 77(3)(b)] in the carrying on of the company's business despite knowing that it was being conducted in a manner prohibited by Section 22(1).
AD 10.9.3.3
Per Section 162(5)(c)(iv)(bb), was a party to an act or omission by the company (or close corporation) [per Section 77(3)(c)] despite knowing that the act or omission was calculated to defraud a creditor, employee or shareholder (or member) of the company (or close corporation), or had another fraudulent purpose.

AD 10.10
Grounds for Probation My son and wife have also contravened Section 162(7) of the Companies Act, which provides that a Court may make an order placing a person (director or member) under probation who, while serving as a director:
AD 10.10.1
Acted in a manner that is materially inconsistent with their duties; [Section 162(7)(a) (ii)]

AD 10.10.2
Per Section 162(a)(iii):
AD 10.10.2.1
Whose conduct had the result that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests;
AD 10.10.2.2
Carried on the business of the corporation in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests;
AD 10.10.2.3
Exercised their powers as director/member in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregards my interests.

10.11-10.13 Conclusion on Delinquency
AD 10.11
Taking into account the manner in which they have acted, and the above legislation, I am advised that I may seek that an order (as I now do) that the ﬁrst and second respondents be declared delinquent, or be placed under probation.
AD 10.12
The full extent of the transgressions, and the ensuing losses to the third to sixth respondents, have yet to be determined; I request accordingly, inter alia, an order authorising me to appoint necessary experts, including the aforesaid bookkeeper, at the cost of the third to sixth respondents, so that a proper forensic investigation may be conducted.
AD 10.13
At this stage already, signiﬁcant sums of money (as aforesaid) cannot be accounted for.
